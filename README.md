# Security Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains two powerful tools for security analysis:
1. Malicious PDF Analyzer
2. File Analysis and VirusTotal Integration Tool
3. VirusTotal IOC Analyzer

# Malicious PDF Analyzer

A Python script that analyzes potentially malicious PDF files and extracts embedded binary data. This tool provides valuable insights into the structure and content of suspicious PDF files, helping security researchers and analysts identify potential threats.

## Features

- Analyzes PDF files for various indicators of malicious content
- Extracts embedded binary files from PDFs
- Generates a comprehensive analysis report
- Calculates MD5 checksum of the PDF file
- Detects embedded JavaScript
- Counts occurrences of binary data, objects, streams, and comments
- Checks for the presence of URIs
- Identifies potential errors or suspicious elements

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyPDF2 library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/malwaredev/malicious-pdf-analyzer.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install PyPDF2
   
## Usage

1. Replace `'path/to/your/pdf/file.pdf'` in the script with the actual path to your PDF file.

2. Run the script: python pdf_analyzer.py
   
3. The script will generate two output files in the current directory:
- `pdf_analysis_output.txt`: Contains the detailed analysis report
- `extracted_binary_data.bin`: Contains any extracted binary data from the PDF (if present)

## Analysis Output

The analysis report includes the following information:

- File name
- MD5 checksum
- File size
- Presence of embedded JavaScript
- Count of binary data occurrences
- Number of objects
- Number of streams
- Presence of URIs
- Number of comments
- List of potential errors or suspicious elements

## Caution

This script is intended for use by security professionals and researchers. Always handle potentially malicious files with care and in a secure, isolated environment.

# VirusTotal Folder Monitor

A powerful PowerShell script for comprehensive file analysis and VirusTotal integration, designed for security professionals and researchers.

## Features

- Calculate multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512) for files
- Check file hashes against VirusTotal
- Upload files to VirusTotal
- Retrieve detailed file information from VirusTotal
- Process individual files or entire folders
- Monitor folders for new files
- Combine log files in text or JSON format

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- VirusTotal API key

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.
2. Open PowerShell and navigate to the script directory.
3. Run the script: ```powershell
`.\VirusTotal_Folder_Monitor.ps1`
4. Follow the prompts to:
   
  Enter the path of the file or folder to analyze
  Choose hash algorithms
  Provide your VirusTotal API key
  Select verbose output option

Main Functions
  Get-MultipleFileHashes: Calculates multiple hash algorithms for a file
  Check-VirusTotal: Checks a file hash on VirusTotal
  Upload-To-VirusTotal: Uploads a file to VirusTotal
  Get-AdditionalFileInfo: Retrieves additional file information from VirusTotal
  Process-Files: Processes files in a folder, calculating hashes and checking VirusTotal
  Monitor-Folder: Monitors a folder for new files and processes them
  Combine-LogFiles: Combines multiple log files into a single file (text or JSON format)
Log Files
  The script generates two types of log files:
  Hash log: Contains file hashes
  VirusTotal log: Contains VirusTotal analysis results
Log files are saved on the desktop with timestamps in the filename.

Notes
Be cautious when uploading files to VirusTotal, as they become publicly accessible.
Respect VirusTotal's API usage limits and terms of service.

# VirusTotal IOC Analyzer

This script analyzes Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) using the VirusTotal API. It supports various types of IOCs, including IP addresses, domain names, URLs, and file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256). The script provides detailed analysis, including detection counts, country and ASN information, and clusters domain names and URLs for further insights.

## Features

- Batch processing of IOCs to reduce the number of API calls.
- Error handling with a retry mechanism for API requests.
- Detailed analysis including detection counts, country, and ASN information.
- Statistical analysis of IOCs.
- Text-based clustering of domain names and URLs.
- IP range analysis to identify clusters of malicious IPs.
- Generates both CSV and JSON reports with the analysis results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `requests`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/virustotal-ioc-analyzer.git
   cd virustotal-ioc-analyzer
   ```
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn requests
```
Usage
Run the script: ``` python VT_IOC_Analyzer.py ```

Follow the prompts to enter the path to your IOC file and your VirusTotal API key.

IOC File Format

The IOC file should be a tab-separated file with each line containing the IOC type and the IOC value. Supported IOC types include:
  
   FileHash-md5
   FileHash-sha1
   FileHash-sha256
   IPv4
   URL
   domain
